--US Census Tracts are identified for test results using a GIS approach. The
-- lat/lon annotated on each test row is looked up in the polygons of US
-- Census Tracts provided by Google Public Datasets.
--
-- **NOTE: Tests are annotated with the lat/lon of the IP address, which
--   preserves some amount of user privacy in our public dataset. IP address
---  locations are less precise than GPS or other methods would provide. 
--   Therefore aggregations at this geographic level should be considered 
--   advisory only, as a means of comparing our large datasets to other, more
--   precise data that may be more location precise.
--
--   To gain more location precision with NDT test results, new tests must be
--   collected using a third-party integration that gathers or requests service
--   location of the user. Examples of such integrations can be found at:
